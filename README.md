# The Constant (k) Coded Programmable State Machine solution presented in this application note is a fully embedded 8-bit microcontroller macro for the Virtex™, Virtex-E, Spartan™-II, and Spartan-IIE devices (see XAPP627 for Virtex-II designs). Although it could be used for processing of data, the macro is most likely to be employed in applications requiring a complex, but non-time-critical state machine. 
# This revised version (for ISE compatibility) of the popular macro has still been developed with one dominant factor being held above all others–its size. The result is a microcontroller that occupies just 76 Spartan-IIE slices, which is 9% of the smallest XC2S50E device and 2.5% of the XC2S300E device. Together with this small amount of logic, a single block RAM is used to form a ROM store for a program of up to 256 instructions. Even with such size constraints, the performance is respectable at approximately 40 MIPS, depending on device speed grade.
# The module is totally embedded into the device and requires no external support. Any logic can be connected to the module inside the Virtex or Spartan device meaning that any additional features can be added to provide ultimate flexibility. It is not so much what is inside the module that makes it useful, but the environment in which it lives.
